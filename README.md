Overview of the Code
This Python script sets up an application for job interview preparation using a combination of PDF text extraction, natural language processing (NLP), and conversational AI. It integrates various technologies to build a chatbot that helps users prepare for interviews by providing information and feedback based on relevant documents.

Components and Libraries
1.	Gradio: A library used to create user interfaces for machine learning models and applications.
2.	HuggingFaceHub: Provides access to the Hugging Face Inference API for language models.
3.	PyMuPDF (fitz): A library to extract text from PDF files.
4.	Sentence Transformers: A library for generating sentence embeddings, useful for measuring text similarity.
5.	FAISS: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

Code Breakdown
1. Imports and Initializations
•	Libraries: Import necessary libraries for text extraction, embedding generation, similarity search, and creating a UI.
•	InferenceClient: Initializes the Hugging Face client to use the zephyr-7b-beta model for generating conversational responses.

2. MyApp Class
The MyApp class handles PDF processing, embedding creation, and document search functionalities.
Initialization: Sets up placeholders for documents, embeddings, and a FAISS index. Loads the PDF and builds the vector database.
load_pdf Method: Opens a PDF file and extracts text from each page, storing it in the documents list.
build_vector_db Method: Uses a sentence transformer model to create embeddings of the document texts, and stores these embeddings in a FAISS index for efficient similarity search.
•	search_documents Method: Converts the user query into an embedding, searches for similar embeddings in the FAISS index, and returns the top-k relevant documents.

3. respond Function
•	respond Function: Constructs a message history including the system message and conversation history. Retrieves relevant documents based on the user's message and appends this context to the messages sent to the conversational AI model. Streams the response from the model and yields it incrementally.

4. Gradio Interface
•	Gradio Setup: Defines a user interface using Gradio. It includes markdown for introductory text and a disclaimer. Sets up a ChatInterface to handle user interactions, using the respond function to generate replies and provide examples of typical questions.

Summary
1.	Initialization: Sets up libraries and initializes the Hugging Face client.
2.	MyApp Class: Handles PDF text extraction, embedding generation, and document search.
3.	respond Function: Constructs conversation history, integrates document retrieval, and streams responses from the AI model.
4.	Gradio Interface: Creates a user interface for interacting with the chatbot, with predefined examples and introductory text.

This code enables users to interact with a chatbot that provides tailored feedback for job interviews, leveraging document-based information and conversational AI for enhanced responses.
